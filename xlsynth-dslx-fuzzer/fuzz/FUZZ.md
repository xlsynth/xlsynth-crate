# DSLX semantics

`fuzz_dslx_semantics` composes checked DSLX AST fragments into a module DAG,
independently instantiates their PIR semantics, converts the formatted DSLX, and
proves top-function equivalence for every input with Bitwuzla. It surfaces
semantic disagreements, specialization/import errors, and unexpected generation,
conversion, parsing, or proof failures. See the [crate guide](../README.md) for
the initial fragment set, bounds, commands, and reproducer workflow.

Setting `DSLX_FUZZ_NATIVE_CONFIG` during the Cargo build also runs an isolated
C++ checker before conversion. Its parser, typechecker, and constexpr bytecode
coverage counters feed the same libFuzzer mutation loop. Native rejection of a
generated program fails the sample. See the [native setup](../native/README.md)
for building the checker, verifying feedback and oracle isolation, and running
with it enabled.

Standalone converter campaigns can set `DSLX_FINDINGS_DIR` to keep fuzzing
after a solver counterexample or an unsuccessful converter exit. Each category
retains the exact input by SHA-256 and a first diagnostic. The optional
`DSLX_PROOF_RESULTS` ledger records `D` for disproof, `R` for converter
rejection, `P` for proof, and `I` for a solver limit. Checker errors still stop
the worker. To reproduce a finding with its full diagnostic, replay the saved
file with the same grammar and converter and unset `DSLX_FINDINGS_DIR`.
